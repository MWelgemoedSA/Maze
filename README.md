# Maze

A basic maze generator and solver. I did it mainly as an exercise to practice java.

It offers four graph travels algorithms, using straight line distance as a heuristic. A*, Greedy Search, and without a heuristic a simple depth first search or a breadth first search.

The maze generation algorithm is a simple recursive division method of a 2d room. It can generate only a single possible solution or many by varying the number of access points in the walls between chambers.
